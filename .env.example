# =====================================
# DOCK SPACING CONFIGURATION
# =====================================

# Dock Spacing Mode (default: adaptive)
# Controls how icons are spaced and aligned in the dock on mobile devices
# 
# Available options:
# - adaptive: Smart mode that switches between extended/compact spacing based on dock state
#   * When extended dock is ON: uses DOCK_SPACING_EXTENDED setting
#   * When extended dock is OFF: uses DOCK_SPACING_COMPACT setting
# - space-evenly: Equal space around each icon, spreads across full mobile width
#   * Best for: When you want consistent full-width distribution regardless of icon count
#   * Effect: Icons evenly distributed with equal spacing between and around them
# - center: Center icons with gap spacing, compact look
#   * Best for: When you want tight grouping of icons in the center
#   * Effect: Icons clustered together in center with minimal spacing
# - space-between: Space between icons only, no space at edges
#   * Best for: Edge-to-edge distribution without outer padding
#   * Effect: First icon at left edge, last at right edge, even spacing between
# - space-around: Space around each icon, smaller gaps than space-evenly
#   * Best for: Balanced distribution with some edge spacing
#   * Effect: Icons distributed with spacing around each, but less than space-evenly
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCK_SPACING_MODE=adaptive

# Extended Dock Spacing (default: space-evenly)
# Used when DOCK_SPACING_MODE=adaptive AND extended dock is enabled (7+ icons visible)
# This setting distributes many icons evenly across the mobile screen width
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCK_SPACING_EXTENDED=space-evenly

# Compact Dock Spacing (default: center)
# Used when DOCK_SPACING_MODE=adaptive AND extended dock is disabled (3 icons visible)
# This setting groups few icons tightly together instead of spreading them out
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCK_SPACING_COMPACT=center

# Dock Gap Size (default: 4)
# Controls the pixel gap between dock icons
# Range: 1-20 pixels
# - Smaller values (1-2): Very tight spacing, minimal gaps
# - Medium values (3-6): Balanced spacing, good readability
# - Larger values (7-20): Loose spacing, more breathing room
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCK_GAP_SIZE=4

# =====================================
# EXAMPLES OF COMMON CONFIGURATIONS
# =====================================

# Configuration 1: Always use tight center spacing (minimal)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCK_SPACING_MODE=center
# NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCK_GAP_SIZE=2

# Configuration 2: Always use full-width distribution (maximal)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCK_SPACING_MODE=space-evenly
# NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCK_GAP_SIZE=6

# Configuration 3: Smart adaptive (recommended - handles both scenarios well)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCK_SPACING_MODE=adaptive
# NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCK_SPACING_EXTENDED=space-evenly
# NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCK_SPACING_COMPACT=center
# NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCK_GAP_SIZE=4
